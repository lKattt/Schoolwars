# Pattern Smash

**THE IDEA**

In this game the player is tasked with saving the world by commanding this magical cube named Cubii to defeat the monsters it accidentally brought to earth. The gameplay is that by using the custom controller we made the player must correctly identify and input the pattern of colour on the screen denoted by the items shown. The items are randomized every sequence. After four sequences in the same setting or themed background it will change the setting, giving the player new items but the colours will remain consistent. What differentiates this game from other arcade style games is our use of the makey makey to create a unique controller that fits the lore of the game. We decided to use a cube. We wanted to have six different item colours for each setting so the player would hold the controller and have to turn it around in their hands constantly looking at the controller and the screen for a more engaging experience. 


# Visuals And Inspiration

We were inspired by BOP IT! initially when we wanted to come up with an interesting concept for the controller. We thought of possibly having different types of inputs. However there are limitations to what sort of interactions we can have with the makey makey so twisting motions and hit motions would read as a touch regardless. So at first we thought of using play dough before we solidified the core concept of the game. Originally we wanted to have one background which was the classroom setting (below is our original mood board for the first game) and to use play dough. After our play test the feedback we got was that was very generic. So we went back to brainstorming what we could do with our game. 


# Changes made after play test 

We started off by thinking with how we could make our game different from other games with similar gameplay loops. With having all inputs on the table it didn't really seem interesting and was simply too easy because we wanted to use basic shapes. So Alex and I thought of using items that had different colours instead of basic shapes. The purpose of this was to have more challenging items that could obscure the correct one while still leaving it possible to figure out what it is. We looked back on WarioWare on the ds actually because we liked the idea of having small "micro games" with a similar loop. However, due to time constraints we focused on one type of gameplay instead of multiple. So I created ideas for other settings based off our everyday world. We were struggling to come up with a possible in game reason after I started on making items for a classroom setting. I thought of maybe having in game lore that would explain why the player is taken through a bunch of different settings. Which is where the monster idea came from. Because of this reasoning I went back and made little faces on each of the items so the player would be 'defeating' the monsters by getting the sequence correct. 


In terms of style the background would either be drawn as a still or animated. We also wanted to have more dance or upbeat music playing in the background to emulate that arcade or warioware feel. All of my design choices stemmed from observing other games and what they all had in common since I wasn't sure what genre the game we were making was. Instead of fully going for 8-bit, I kept more bright colours and fun cartoons to keep the playful vibe but still fit within my style. In order to differentiate the settings from each other, I wanted to make them different themes to help easily identify which is which. I had troubles coming up with a nicely fitting colour pallet that would work with the constant colours of the items.

# Plans and challenges

As of now, we wanted to implement a way for the player to know their score in the game end screen. We didn't complete it in time. Because of changing our gameplay loop we struggled quite a bit with making a very ambitious redo of our original game. There are many smalls things like the game end score we thought more of as a stretch goal since we wanted to get the game essentially complete and fully functional save for UI adjustments I wanted to make later on. 

Other things were audio cues for when the timer speeds up and a better method for our controller to make it more durable. I wanted the colours to be almost the same shade if not an exact match which was hard to find the right materials for. I chose to use paper for the prototype but was hoping to use foamcore and paint it later on to be able to withstand someone holding it. It's very sensitive so you can't really pick it up at the moment. I liked the tactile feedback of having flaps that would connect two strips of tin foil together. However that lead to sensitivity issues. 

For a long time we struggle with the timers we were using. The game would infinitely randomize the items continously. We sought out help from our classmates to come up with a solution. Thomas R. helped us modify our code to be functional, you can find his comments marke with a t in our code comments! 

# Suggestions and feedback from final playtest

We had some great suggestions during our final play test. So maybe in the future we could implement visual cues and animations to help the player know what's going on. I think right now clarity is somewhat of an issue. Since everything is truly random sometiems the background won't seem to change even if it did. Maybe ensurong that the same background doesn't show up twice in a row could remedy that.
