# BOP IT! 

**THE IDEA**

The goal of our project is to emulate the play style of bop it in our own way. We are doing this by using the makey makey to function as touch buttons. Ideally we'd use play dough for an interesting tactile experience. As the player continues to press the correct buttons it will then progress faster until the player cannot accurately press the buttons anymore. Two ideas for this would be to have a timer or for it to go faster without warning.  


# Things we need

[x] wire / copper wire 

# Code
[x] Background 
[x] Press Start?? 
[x] School related? / kindergarten themed?
[x] Buttons that work with makey makey 
[x] Goes faster over time? 
[x] Timer

# Visuals And Inspiration

The main idea is that it is set in a kindergarten classroom. The play dough will be used as buttons set in front of the player on a table. The shape will be displayed on a screen or projected onto a wall. 

In terms of style the background would either be drawn as a still or animated. Currently we are thinking of using music in the background to excite the player while they are interacting with our piece.
