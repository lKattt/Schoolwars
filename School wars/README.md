# Pattern Smash

**THE IDEA**

In this game the player is tasked with saving the world by commanding this magical cube named Cubii to defeat the monsters it accidentally brought to earth. The gameplay is that by using the custom controller we made the player must correctly identify and input the pattern of colour on the screen denoted by the items shown. The items are randomized every sequence. After four sequences in the same setting or themed background it will change the setting, giving the player new items but the colours will remain consistent. What differentiates this game from other arcade style games is our use of the makey makey to create a unique controller that fits the lore of the game. We decided to use a cube. We wanted to have six different item colours for each setting so the player would hold the controller and have to turn it around in their hands constantly looking at the controller and the screen for a more engaging experience. 


# Visuals And Inspiration

We were inspired by BOP IT! initially when we wanted to come up with an interesting concept for the controller. We thought of possibly having different types of inputs. However there are limitations to what sort of interactions we can have with the makey makey so twisting motions and hit motions would read as a touch regardless. So at first we thought of using play dough before we solidified the core concept of the game. Originally we wanted to have one background which was the classroom setting (below is our original mood board for the first game) and to use play dough. After our play test the feedback we got was that was very generic. So we went back to brainstorming what we could do with our game. 


# Changes made after play test 

We started off by thinking with how we could make our game different from other games with similar gameplay loops. With having all inputs on the table it didn't really seem interesting and was simply too easy because we wanted to use basic shapes. So Alex and I thought of using items that had different colours instead of basic shapes. The purpose of this was to have more challenging items that could obscure the correct one while still leaving it possible to figure out what it is. We looked back on WarioWare on the ds actually because we liked the idea of having small "micro games" with a similar loop. However, due to time constraints we focused on one type of gameplay instead of multiple. So I created ideas for other settings based off our everyday world. We were struggling to come up with a possible in game reason after I started on making items for a classroom setting. I thought of maybe having in game lore that would explain why the player is taken through a bunch of different settings. Which is where the monster idea came from. Because of this reasoning I went back and made little faces on each of the items so the player would be 'defeating' the monsters by getting the sequence correct. 



In terms of style the background would either be drawn as a still or animated. We also wanted to have more dance or upbeat music playing in the background to emulate that arcade or warioware feel. All of my design choices stemmed from observing other games and what they all had in common since I wasn't sure what genre the game we were making was. Instead of fully going for 8-bit, I kept more bright colours and fun cartoons to keep the playful vibe but still fit within my style. In order to differentiate the settings from each other, I wanted to make them different themes to help easily identify which is which. I had troubles coming up with a nicely fitting colour pallet that would work with the constant colours of the items.
